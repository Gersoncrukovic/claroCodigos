1️⃣ Why Conversion Double Counting

2️⃣ The Best Solution for GTM


While auditing my client’s GTM setups, I often come across this common issue. But don’t worry—I’ve identified an effective solution to fix it!


● Why Conversion Double Counting:

→ The most common reason is multiple page loads on the thank-you page:

→ If a user refreshes the thank-you page after landing on it, the trigger fires again.

→ As a result, the conversion is counted twice, leading to inaccurate data.


● Best Solution for GTM: 

→ Here’s how you can prevent double counting using a simple JavaScript variable in GTM:

Step 1: Go to GTM > Variables > New Variable, and select "Custom JavaScript".

Step 2: Paste the following JavaScript code:

function(){
return performance.navigation.type === 1;
}

Step 3: Return to GTM > Open your target tag, and set a condition in your trigger to fire only when this Custom JavaScript variable returns false.


→ This simple fix ensures that your conversion tag fires only once, even if the thank-you page is reloaded.
